      User Interface:
      ☑️ Create piece component
      - Create piece deck component
      ☑️ Create player hand component
      - Create player card component
        - Rotatable pieces????? 🤔
      - Create opponent card component
      - Create "I'm done" button
      - Create "Wait no I'm not!!" button

      Game Logic:
      - Setup colyseus server
      - Setup colyseus client
      - Learn about how colyseus manages game state
      - Determine flow and steps of game
      
      Game entities to track:
      - Deck
      - Player's Hand
      - Opponent's Hands
        - Must be server side
        - Actually everything should be server side because people could
          manipulate the game state on the client side.
      - Player's Card
        - Pieces on the card
        - Piece positions 
        - Piece rotations
      - Opponent's Card
        - Same as player's card
      - All players' scores
      - Player statuses
        - Done
        - Still playing
      
      Thoughts:
        - Maybe the game shouldn't be very strict about the rules.
        - Maybe it just lets players have their little cards and then show them to people?
        - That's how it will start, then more game logic can be added.
        - Server will still need to manage state for all of the above
